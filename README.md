## Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to the Main Page
Here, the page provides following information regarding the products.
- Subscribed Products: a user can opt for a subscription service where he/she can select a few products to be bought automatically after a fixed interval eg. every month, week, etc. The page shows products subscribed by the user.
- Recommended Products: the page displays recommended products based on past history. For a new user, it shows recommendations using star rating.
### 2. Navigate to any Product Page
When you navigate to a product page, you'll find the following features:

- Product Listing: view a list of available dress products.
- Product Interaction: choose a product based on your preference.
- Wishlist:add the selected product to your wishlist.
- Shopping Cart: include the product in your cart for future purchase.
- Comments: read or add comments related to the product. This uses an ML model which classifies each tweet as either positive or negative and this information helps in the recommendation system.
- Similar Products: It displays images with similar features.

### 3. Navigate to Subscription Page
When you navigate to a subscription page, add the following details:
- Duration: type the number of days (integer). If you enter 7, it will buy the selected product automatically after every 7 days.
- Product ID: type the product id (integer starting from 0) of the product that the application will buy automatically after a fixed interval of time. Due to limited time, product id has been asked instead of selecting product names or images.


### 4. Twilio Messages

A user gets notifications on phone for the following reasons:
- When the price of a product in the wishlist gets discounted.
- When the unavailable product in the wishlist becomes available.

# Scope of Improvement

While developing this application, we faced time constraints that prevented the inclusion of additional features. However, to enhance the overall user experience, the following features could be considered for future development:

### 1. Multi-User Support:

Current State: The application is designed to accommodate a single user.
Enhancement: Extend the application to support multiple users, providing a more inclusive and interactive experience for a broader user base. This could involve user authentication, personalized profiles, and individualized preferences.

### 2. Subscription Page Enhancement:

Current State: The subscription page currently requires users to input a product ID, which is an integer starting from 0.
Enhancement: Improve the subscription page by allowing users to add various products with a more user-friendly approach. Instead of manually entering product IDs, users should be able to choose products from a list, accompanied by images. This simplifies the selection process and enhances the visual appeal of the subscription page.

### 3. Multiple Product Subscription:
Current State: The subscription functionality is limited to allowing users to add only one product.
Enhancement: Enhance the subscription feature to enable users to subscribe to multiple products. This flexibility allows users to explore and engage with a broader range of offerings, tailoring their subscriptions to diverse preferences and needs. Implementing this improvement can significantly enrich the user experience and increase the application's appeal to a wider audience.
